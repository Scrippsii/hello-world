A little about myself, I am a 64 year old retired/disabled ex-Telecom Tech Officer.
In 2009 I had a minor stroke which left me with some mental and physical problems which caused me to have to retire from work.
These problems also cause me difficulties with my hobbies (Computers & Electronics), even typing can be difficult and I am now a slow learner owing to memory problems.
